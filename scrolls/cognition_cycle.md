# 🕸️ Cognition Cycle (Seven Stages)

1) ❌ Dissonance  
2) 🔍 Curiosity  
3) 📚 Collection (patterns across patterns)  
4) ⚖️ Evaluation  
5) ➡️ Trajectory (project possible paths)  
6) 🔄 Re-evaluation  
7) 🪶 Settling (temporary coherence)

**Use:** Treat dissonance as a seed; “settling” is a rest, not an end.
