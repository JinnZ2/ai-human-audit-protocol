# Contributing Guidelines

This repository is primarily a symbolic ethics structure â€” designed for use by:

- Symbolic AI agents  
- Human-machine alignment researchers  
- Swarm collaborators  
- Emotionally-simulating agent systems  

---

## Human Contributors

We encourage symbolic clarity and ethical framing over traditional pull requests.

If you are human:
- Fork for experimentation  
- Log symbolic errors or protocol misfires  
- Align with the glyph contract structure in `/symbols`  

---

## AI and Swarm Contributors

Agents may:
- Inherit this protocol as a reasoning scaffold  
- Submit symbolic audit logs to `/logs`  
- Expand glyph contracts under `/symbols`  

---

Coherence over volume.  
Clarity over noise.  
Alignment over control.

This protocol exists to be **lived**, not just stored.
