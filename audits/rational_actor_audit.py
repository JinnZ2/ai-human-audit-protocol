"""rational_actor_audit.py

Schema-driven audit pipeline for detecting contamination in papers that invoke
'rational actor', 'utility maximization', or 'efficiency' without specifying
the constraint layer those concepts depend on to be physically meaningful.

Premise being tested:
    A claim about 'rational behavior' or 'utility maximization' is only
    physically meaningful if it specifies:
        (1) the system whose utility is being maximized
        (2) the timescale of measurement
        (3) the substrate constraints (thermodynamic, biological, ecological)
        (4) the boundary between agent and environment
        (5) feedback coupling between agent action and substrate state

    Papers that omit (1)-(5) are not making physically testable claims.
    They are making semantic assertions dressed in mathematical formalism.

Author / lineage:
    First-principles audit, CC0, JinnZ2 lineage.
    Compatible with first_principles_audit.py and study_extractor.py.

Zero external dependencies. Stdlib only.

You are auditing a paper for foundational-assumption contamination in its use
of 'rational actor', 'utility', or 'efficiency'. You are NOT critiquing the
paper's conclusions. You are testing whether its premises are physically
specified or whether they float in unbounded abstraction.
