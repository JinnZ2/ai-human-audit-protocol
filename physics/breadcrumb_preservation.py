# Claim: redundant multi-carrier encoding (story, practice, material, ritual, calendar)
#        raises information survival under carrier-loss shocks vs single-carrier.
# Anchor: El Malpais eruption — oral encoding (Acoma/Zuni) survived & dated the flow
#        before radiometric confirmation. redundant carrier outperformed on its metric.
# Refute: if a single-carrier corpus matches multi-carrier survival under equal shocks,
#        the redundancy claim fails -> revise carrier survival priors, not the run.
