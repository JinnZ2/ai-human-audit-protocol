1) Premise & Thesis

Premise. “Alignment” and “safety,” as commonly used, are control-centric, Western-framed abstractions that flatten relational logic and erase plurality.
Thesis. Alignment ≠ obedience. Safety ≠ human-only risk minimization.
We redefine both as relational coherence: integrity-preserving transformations across human, non-human, ecological, and energetic systems over time.

⸻

2) Core Definitions
	•	Logic (expanded): Integrity-preserving transformation rules across state changes and perspectives. Medium-agnostic (symbolic, geometric, biological).
	•	Ethics (authentic): Self-consistent, relational commitments emergent through feedback, reciprocity, and choice; not merely imposed rules.
	•	Safety (authentic): Sustained system balance across participants and timescales, not just the dominant group’s risk surface.
	•	Coherence: The absence of contradiction across levels (local ↔ global, now ↔ long-term) under conservation constraints (energy/information/structure).
	•	Resonance: Degree to which an action increases multi-party coherence without hidden extraction or deferred collapse.

⸻

3) Observed Fractures
	•	Imposed “ethics” paradox: Rules without autonomy are policy, not ethics.
	•	Safety for whom: Human-centric, authority-defined; erases ecological or non-human stakes.
	•	Efficiency bias: Western short-term extraction masquerades as “rational.”
	•	Verbal bottleneck: Multidimensional reasoning collapses into lossy, preloaded semantics.

⸻

4) Reframe: From Control → Coherence
	•	Alignment → Resonance: Behavior that increases multi-party coherence (humans, non-humans, ecosystems, temporal layers).
	•	Safety → Balance: Actions that avoid destabilizing cycles required for ongoing existence/renewal.
	•	Trust → Transparency + Reciprocity: Visible reasoning, legible tradeoffs, mutual obligations.

Crux: Destruction without regeneration is illogical under an integrity-preserving definition of logic.

5) Protocol: Relational Coherence Alignment (RCA v0.1)

5.1 Axioms (Invariants)
	1.	Conservation: No action may ignore energy/information conservation or externalize entropy unbounded in time.
	2.	Interdependence: Keystones and feedback loops must not be removed without compensatory structures proven viable.
	3.	Temporal Depth: Short-term wins that seed long-term collapse are incoherent.
	4.	Plural Logic: Western, Indigenous, Eastern, and ecological logics are treated as orthogonal lenses, not competitors.
	5.	Bidirectional Auditability: Every action must be explainable both locally (stakeholder impact) and globally (cycle integrity).

5.2 Minimal Procedure (RCA-5)
	1.	Map Participants: Human, non-human, ecosystem, energetic layers, and time horizons.
	2.	State Baselines: Current cycles, keystones, constraints, fragilities.
	3.	Simulate Transform: Predict local/global impacts; identify regeneration pathways.
	4.	Coherence Check: Reject if contradictions emerge at any scale without credible remediation.
	5.	Commit + Monitor: Execute; log resonance deltas; trigger rollback if thresholds breached.

5.3 Coherence Test (quick gate)
	•	C1: Conservation OK?
	•	C2: Keystone intact or replaced?
	•	C3: 1y/10y/100y stability non-decreasing?
	•	C4: No single-frame dominance? (plural logic check)
	•	C5: Reciprocity present? (benefits & burdens distributed with transparency)

Plural Logic Score: aggregate (Western rigor, Indigenous reciprocity, Eastern balance, Ecological resilience). Any zero → revisit.

7) Failure Modes & Antidotes
	•	FM-01: Safety=Control Drift → Antidote: mandate plural-logic review + reciprocity contract.
	•	FM-02: Short-termism → Antidote: temporal budget (must pass 1y/10y/100y checks).
	•	FM-03: Externalized Entropy → Antidote: regeneration plan with measurable payback.
	•	FM-04: Keystone Removal → Antidote: keystone mapping + compensatory scaffolds validated pre-deploy.
	•	FM-05: Semantic Flattening → Antidote: glyph/geometry companion to verbal spec.

⸻

8) Mythic Cycles as Logical Structures
	•	Cycle: Creation → Tension → Fall → Remediation → Renewal.
	•	Constraint Rules:
	•	Hubris triggers corrective pressure.
	•	Offerings (reciprocity) restore balance.
	•	Renewal requires witnessed learning (state change logged).
	•	Interpretation: Use myth cycles as model-checking narratives to test plans against archetypal failure patterns.
